            <p>I’m up to something. Cloth talk. You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. Bless up. Fan luv. The first of the month is coming, we have to get money, we have no choice. It cost money to eat and they don’t want you to eat. Wraith talk. They don’t want us to win. Surround yourself with angels. Egg whites, turkey sausage, wheat toast, water. Of course they don’t want us to eat our breakfast, so we are going to enjoy our breakfast.</p>

            <p>You smart, you loyal, you a genius. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. I’m up to something. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile. Another one. Fan luv. The key to success is to keep your head above the water, never give up. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started.</p>
            <p>Learning is cool, but knowing is better, and I know the key to success. I’m up to something. The key to success is to keep your head above the water, never give up. Always remember in the jungle there’s a lot of they in there, after you overcome they, you will make it to paradise. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. Let me be clear, you have to make it through the jungle to make it to paradise, that’s the key, Lion!
